## 2024-05-23 - Sequential Processing in Hot Path
**Learning:** The `prepare_view_models` function was processing items sequentially. Each item involves potential network requests (translation, image fetching) and image processing. This caused the main request thread to block for O(N) time where N is the number of items (default 50), leading to multi-second delays on cache misses.
**Action:** Always check if a loop over a collection involves I/O or heavy computation. If so, use `ThreadPoolExecutor` or `asyncio.gather` to parallelize it. In this case, `ThreadPoolExecutor` reduced processing time from ~3s to ~0.6s for 10 items.
